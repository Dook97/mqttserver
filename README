A simple MQTT server

Final program for the UNIX programming in C class at MFF
UK during winter semester 23/24.

========================================================

`$ make` to build
`$ make EXTERNFLAGS="-DDEBUG -DCOLOR -g"` to build in
debug mode

Only supports QoS 0 among other limitations.

Just to make sure: DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS.

This is a project for me to learn about UNIX systems
programming (also to get a credit). Developing a
practically usable MQTT server is a non-goal.
